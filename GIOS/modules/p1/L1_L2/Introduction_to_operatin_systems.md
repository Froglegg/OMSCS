## introduction to OS
- what is an operating system?
a piece of software that abstracts (simplify) and arbitrates (to manage) the underlying hardware system
## Visual metaphor
An OS is like a toy shop manager:
1. Directs operational resources (controls use of employee time, parts, tools)
2. enforces working policies (fairness, safety, clean-up)
3. mitigates difficulties of complex tasks (simplifies and optimizes operation)
An OS
1. controls use of CPU, memory, peripheral devices
2. fair resource access, limiting resource usage etc.
3. abstracts hardware details (system calls)
## What is an operating system?
- hardware pieces include CPU, main memory, disk, GPU, usbs, wifi card, etc.
- software pieces include multiple applications
- An operating system is the layer of system software that sits between the hardware and the software applications
Hiding hardware complexity, for example, in a web server, the operating system provides sockets, an interface that abstracts bits of network communication so you don't have to worry about lower level network communication issues
- resource management
- provide isolation and protection for components
