# Microkernel
A kernel is an important part of an OS that manages system resources.
A microkernel is a software or code which contains the required minimum amount of functions, data, and features to implement an operating system.

Some benefits:
- size
- verifiability
Drawbacks:
- portability (often specialized for specific platforms)
- complexity of software development (because issue above)
- high cost of user/kernel crossing (frequent kernel crossings)
