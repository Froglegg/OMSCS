sequence of porgamming projects;
- threads (using pthreads), concurrency, synchronization
- single node os mechanisms (inter-process communication, scheduling)
- multi-node OS mechanisms (remote procedure calls RPC)
- experimental design and evaluations (provide insight into behavior of OS so you can better understand its capabilities)

-- I'll probably be just using the Linux Programming Interface
-- check online or in the linux programming interface book for pthreads
